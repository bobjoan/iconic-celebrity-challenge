        <p>
          Michael Jackson, born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, was a
          global music icon known as the "King of Pop." He began his career as a
          child performer with the Jackson 5, a group formed with his siblings.
          Michael quickly emerged as the standout talent, showcasing his
          exceptional singing and dancing abilities. In 1971, Michael embarked
          on a solo career, releasing albums that solidified his status as a
          solo artist. His 1982 album "Thriller" became the best-selling album
          of all time, featuring hits like "Billie Jean," "Beat It," and the
          title track "Thriller." The album's success catapulted Michael to
          superstardom, making him a cultural phenomenon. Throughout his career,
          Michael Jackson broke barriers in the music industry, blending pop,
          rock, and R&B genres to create a unique sound. His innovative dance
          moves, including the iconic moonwalk, revolutionized the music video
          landscape. Beyond his musical talents, Michael was also a
          philanthropist, supporting various charitable causes and using his
          platform to advocate for social issues. Despite facing personal
          challenges and controversies, Michael Jackson's impact on music and
          popular culture remains unparalleled. His influence can be seen in the
          work of countless artists who have been inspired by his artistry and
          creativity. Tragically, Michael passed away on June 25, 2009, but his
          legacy continues to live on through his timeless music and enduring
          influence on the entertainment industry.

        <h2>Timeline in Michael Jackson's life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The 'Thriller' album and music video:</strong>
          The album Thriller reinvented all standards of commercial pop success.
          Released on November 30, 1982, it debuted at No. 1, containing seven
          top 10 hits on Billboard Hot 100, including the rock-driven cautionary
          tale “Beat It” and the plaintive “Billie Jean,” as well as the spooky
          but danceable title track. The album made Jackson the first artist to
          win eight Grammy Awards in one night. Thriller stayed at the top of
          the charts for 37 weeks, which was a first, and though its position
          waned, it shot back to No. 1 when its ghoulish video was released a
          year later. The video’s unison zombie dance still inspires mass groups
          to try the choreography, and the album continues to be the world’s
          best-selling album with estimated sales of at least 66 million,
          according to the Guinness World Records, though some estimates set the
          number much higher.

          <strong>Debuting the moonwalk and his signature glove:</strong>
          On May 16, 1983, Jackson stunned the world with the moonwalk, the
          backward gliding step he adapted from street dance. He debuted the
          move while performing the song “Billie Jean” to cap off NBC’s
          broadcast of Motown 25, an anniversary tribute to the label. Though
          the moonwalk had been seen on the streets, Jackson polished the move
          and raised it to a sharper level, adding on his spin and toe-stand as
          flourish. The moonwalk became a signature and a generation-defining
          dance move. In the same performance, Jackson debuted his one
          rhinestone-encrusted white glove, a costume choice that would define
          his look for years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show:</strong>
          He took the world stage on January 31, 1993. And he stood there — for
          what seemed like an outrageously long time for live television. He was
          allowing us to take in the King of Pop, who, by 1993, had faded from
          glory. But then he earned that title all over again with a fast-paced,
          TV-history changing show. Until 1993, halftime entertainment was
          corny, mostly lead by marching bands. With Jackson’s performance, the
          NFL had a new standard: Juggernauts only.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Leading "We are the World":</strong>
          In 1985, Jackson used his international mega-stardom for good when he
          and Lionel Richie co-wrote the song “We are the World” to support
          African-famine relief. With producer Quincy Jones, they recorded the
          song with about three dozen of the hottest, most famous vocalists at
          the time, including headliners Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Billy Joel,
          Tina Turner and Ray Charles. The charity recording, released in 1985
          as a single, raised more than $60 million under the auspices of USA
          for Africa, which continues to operate today. Jackson's solos on the
          album, and his gold-brocade black jacket in the video, still stand out
          as the highlight of the ultimate supergroup.
